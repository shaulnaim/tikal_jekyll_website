</div><h2>The Fundamentals of Scaling Rails App</h2><div class='offering-description'><div><a name="scale"></a><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">The next step after building your website is to plan and prepare it for higher website exposure through different channels. Your website must successfully face massive visitors landing without crashing or slowing down significantly.</span></div>

<div>
<p>This can be achieved by applying time-proven techniques which constantly used by industria giants.</p>

<p>We are going to use Open Source tools and bring you from having a basic functional website to the point when it can face new challenges.</p>

<p>There is an old myth claiming that Rails isn&#39;t scalable. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
We are going to prove it wrong in practice. In fact, Rails is used everywhere, and unlike PHP it&#39;s used more in high-traffic websites just to name a few - Shopify, &nbsp;AirBnb, YellowPages, Groupon.</p>
