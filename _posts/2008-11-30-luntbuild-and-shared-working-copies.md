<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Background</strong>:</p> <p>Client's luntbuild machine is running on a 64 bit machine and he needs to perform post-builds on the same working copy luntbuild checkouts from, problem is that the remote machine is using an SVN 1.5 client and the luntbuild machine is using 1.4 version - therefore when the 32 bit client tries to read the working copy from luntbuild's work dir the build fails - on the svn update part of the build!.</p> <p>In General: In Tikal-ALM's version of luntbuild - luntbuild 1.5.6, luntbuild uses 1.4 version of svn which means that the .svn / _svn directory created under luntbuild's workdir is saved in a 1.4 version, and if a different client for example tortoise / eclipse doesn't use the same svn client version, we won't be able to keep files in svn context because the 1.4 client saves the .svn in a different way and only 1.4 clients would be able to read it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Target</strong>: Use luntbuild to checkout a working copy with 1.5 version of svn.</p> <p>The <strong>non-elegant</strong> &ldquo;work around&rdquo; is using a script which will convert the working copy from 1.4 to 1.5 and visa verse, so the 32 bit machine can read from the same working copy - this script is attached to this post (<a href="https://planet.tikalk.com/community/files/change-svn-wc-format.py_.txt">see below</a>).</p> <p>The <strong>elegant</strong> way is to force luntbuild to use the systems default svn client which is quite simple actually, go to your luntbuild web interface choose your project then create a <b>new</b> (if you convert the existing one you loose all directories realted to checkout) VCS adapter and in &quot;Version Control System&quot; instead of using &quot;subversion&quot; use &quot;subversionExe&quot; - this will force luntbuild to use the OS's version of subversion instead of the svn client luntbuild uses out of luntbuild's environment. Once you have a new VCS adapter with subversionExe copy 'n' paste your existing svn locations related to that VCS then remove the old VCS adapter &ndash; if you dont remove it luntbuild will use both VCS adapters during build!</p> <p><strong>please note:</strong> this was only tested on linux - but I presume windows will give the same result.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In luntbuild 1.6.x this problem should resolve itself because luntbuild is going to use version 1.5 of svn client. Although I believe, we will then be facing problems with clients that need 1.4 checkout from SVN - in those cases we should use the same example of the subversionEXE VCS adapter but make sure the systems svn client is 1.4.x</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
