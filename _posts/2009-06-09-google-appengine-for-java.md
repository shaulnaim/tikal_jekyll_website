<p>Here is <a href="http://blog.newsplore.com/?p=1093">part 1</a> and <a href="http://blog.newsplore.com/?p=1205">part 2</a> of some guy's walkthrough in migrating his application to GAE (including Spring 3, JMX, AOP, and a bunch of other technologies). Interesting to read, and more interesting for me is to wonder who is going to use a JEE runtime which does not allow for &quot;LIKE&quot; queries, persisting more than one root object per transaction and a bunch of other funky limitations. As I commented on his piece:</p>

<div><em>&quot;On the whole, GAE looks to me like a piece of c**p. Useless for anything other than fun(doubt that, too):<br />
jpa limitations blow (same as the python version, btw) and all these quirks, memory errors and missing classes - sheeeesh! like the modifications the Groovy team had to put into their latest version in order to be &ldquo;gae compatible&rdquo;. what&rsquo;s that, then? load of bullocks. not to say that Google owes anything to anyone, after all it&rsquo;s a free service and all, but still, it reminded me of IE&rsquo;s applet support <img class="wp-smiley" alt=":(" src="http://blog.newsplore.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" /><br />
Seems like Google is making a (bad) habbit out of breaking and slicing the Java platform with all their </em><i>new and exiting</i><em> technologies: GWT, Android, and now this. Very nice way to contribute back :\. it&rsquo;s all abomination if you ask me - thanks but no thanks.&quot;</em></div>

<p>The blogposts are still pretty good reading, though...</p>
