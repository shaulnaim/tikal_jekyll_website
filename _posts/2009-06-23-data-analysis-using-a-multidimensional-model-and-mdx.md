<p>Almost all mature database applications reaches a point when it needs to start reporting back statistical and aggregated data. The data about past behavior is usually kept in a transaction history log table and you will be tempted to write some fancy SQL that selects the records in a specific timeslot and then GROUPBY type, or country, or whatever while COUNTing, SUMming and AVGing on some values like profit or whatever make sense to your company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, there's a better way !&nbsp;</p>
<!--break-->
<p>For the purpose of aggregating records, the most robust approach is to use a Multidimensional model (a.k.a OLAP).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is usually quite simple to transform the data into a multidimensional datamart or to build it on top of the existing tables, once it is there it becomes simple to generate smart views of the data using MDX.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best thing about it, is that it is a foundation for additional cool software such as Pivot tables, Flash charts, Dashboards and Reports.</p>
