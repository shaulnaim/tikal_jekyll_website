Hi everyone,
I'd like to share with you a simple yet pragmatic implementation of some ALM use cases based on Apache Maven 
http://pillitu.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/maven-calm/
The main idea of this simple cross-corporate POM is to share the best practices of Apache Maven - being IMO the best build tool which implements the concept of application lifecycle - in a collaborative and open way.
I'd be very interested to hear your opinions and criticisms.
Thanks in advance,

Maurizio
