<p>After multiple re -deployments of several EARs (each is about 10 MB), this directory occupied almost 15GB (!) . We experienced this issue on all our development machines after an upgrade to Jboss5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only it is occupying space but also taking ages to load while scanning this directory.</p>
<p>Has anyone faced this issue?</p>
