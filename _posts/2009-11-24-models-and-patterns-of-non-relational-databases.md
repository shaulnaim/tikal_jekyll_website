<p>Many companies are starting to follow the large Web players (Google, Yahoo, FaceBook, Amazon &amp;c) in adopting scalable non-relational databases, that can handle the extreme demands of web-scale. New &quot;nosql&quot; databases not only address these demands, but also do it efficiently without the huge traditional costs of RDBMS clusters &amp; storage solutions.</p>
