<p>From the site:</p>
<p>The Drizzle project is building a database optimized for Cloud and Net applications. It is being designed for massive concurrency on modern multi-cpu/core architecture. The code is originally derived from MySQL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Drizzle team is removing non-essential code, refactoring the remaining code, switching to a microkernel architecture (with well-defined APIs) and generally making Drizzle into a lean, mean query-running machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is sort of an answer to the NoSQL movement...</p>
