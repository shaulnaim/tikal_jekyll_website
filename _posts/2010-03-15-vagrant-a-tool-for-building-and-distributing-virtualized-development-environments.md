<p>&nbsp;Vagrant (<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 19px; font-size: 12px; "><a href="http://vagrantup.com/">http://vagrantup.com/</a>) aims to make it easy to create environments for developing applications. Today's enterprise applications depend on many external tools and libraries to operate. Having to set these on the developer's own machine is tedious, error prone and leads to conflicts as the product evolves and dependencies change.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vagrant is in essence a virtualbox management tool that uses chef to setup the required tools</p>
