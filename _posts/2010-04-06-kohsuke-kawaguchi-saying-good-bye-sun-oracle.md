<p>Kohsuke  Kawaguchi is saying goodbye to Oracle (Sun) and starting-up / continuing Hudson-CI project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Even though I leave Oracle, I'll continue to lead the Hudson project.  I'll be working with Oracle to transfer the infrastructure services to  their IT operations team. There might be some out-of-schedule releases,  service disruptions, and other inconveniences during this period, but  hopefully things will be back in order relatively quickly.&quot;</p>
