<p>From the site:</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px;">Chronon is a revolutionary new technology that consists of -</p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-size: 14px;">A <i>'flight data recorder'</i> for Java  programs which can record every line of code executed inside a program  and save it to a file on the disk.                                 The file can be shared among developers  and played back in our special time travelling debugger to instantly  find the root cause of an issue.                                 This also means that no bugs ever need  to be reproduced!</li>
    <br />
    <li style="font-size: 14px;">A Time Travelling Debugger, with a novel  UI that plugs seamlessly into Eclipse, which allows you to playback the  recordings. It not  only step back and forth but to any point in the  execution of your program.</li>
</ul>
