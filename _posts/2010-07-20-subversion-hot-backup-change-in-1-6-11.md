<p>An important notice to users of the hot-backup.py utility which ships with subversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found our nightly backup of subversion was failing with the following error:</p>
<pre title="code" class="brush: xhtml;">
svnadmin: Can't open file '/pathtorepo/db/fsfs.conf': No such file or directory
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was troubling me was:</p>
<ol>
    <li>How come a file is missing in my svn repository - nothing has changes (As far as I know ... <img src="http://www.tikalk.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="" />)</li>
    <li>hot-backup.py script hasen't changed much, how come my version has changed ?</li>
</ol>
<p class="rteindent1">&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I looked up the subversion's change log: http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/tags/1.6.12/CHANGES which is the latest release (1.6.12) and took a look on my svn machine to find which version was installed and I found 1.6.12 was indeed in talled and in 1.6.11 release notes you will find:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre title="code" class="brush: xhtml;">
* make 'svnadmin hotcopy' copy the fsfs config file (r905303)
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition I took a look at hot-bakup.py change log under: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/subversion/trunk/tools/backup/hot-backup.py.in?view=log, and found that indeed the fsfs file has be included in the hotbackup script since the 1.6.11 version of the file (see link speified above).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Googeling on the fsfs.conf subject led me to: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.subversion.user/97647 which noted the same exact issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do we solve this issue</strong><strong> ?</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a test repository - svnadmin create /tmp/svntest which will create the fsfs.conf under /tmp/svntest/db/fsfs.conf</li>
    <li>Copy the fsfs.conf to your svnroot/db directory and walla you have the fsfs.conf (what this file does is a different topic)</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<p>1. The svnadmin upgrade -<strong>Doesn't add this file so unless you are using an old veriosn of the hot-backup.py script your backups will fail!!!</strong> (beleive me I tried).</p>
<p>2. If you update subverison - don't forget to run <em>svnadmin upgrade /pathto yourrepo/</em> or you miss all the point of upgrading</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I've learened that subversion was upgraded (again which doesn't say your repository was upgraded!!!) - but when? - considering the fact I am running CentOS - and I didn't have to compile SVN from source and start checking the subversion binaries Creation / Update time I used RPM to tell me when subverions was installed and there is was:</p>
<pre title="code" class="brush: xhtml;">
[root@dev ~]# rpm -qi subversion

<p>I think the #1&nbsp; lesson learned here is before you upgrade read the release notes, see if it impacts you environment in any way - then you can upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you find this useful.</p>
