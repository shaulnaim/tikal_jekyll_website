<p>From the site:&nbsp;Did you ever want to integrate Maven's dependency resolution mechanism  into your application and ended up trying to embed Plexus and an entire  Maven distribution? Did you ever want to use Maven's dependency  resolution mechanism in a multi-threaded fashion and got burned by the  stateful singletons in there? Did you ever want to have a little more  control over how Maven calculates the resolved dependency graph, say use  another strategy for conflict resolution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, Aether is designed to work with all kinds of repositories. A repository where dependencies are written in POM&nbsp;files is just one implementation. </p>
