<p>Netflix uses three NoSQL tools: SimpleDB, HBase and Cassandra. &quot;The  reason why we use multiple NoSQL solutions is because each one is best  suited for a specific set of use cases,&quot; Izrailevsky writes. He writes  that the learning curve has been steep and re-architecting the company's  systems has been difficult but &quot;the scalability, availability and  performance advantages of the NoSQL persistence model are evident and  are paying for themselves already, and will be central to our long-term  cloud strategy.&quot;</p>
