<p>The Debian project has released its new stable version 6.0 code name squeeze.<br />
<br />
Although most of us don't use Debian and probably never will while ubuntu is here, still, I think debian is a corner stone in the free software world and a project and community we should all look up to when thinking of open source communities. and for that , every debian release is an important event.<br />
and btw, debian is not so hard to use as it used to be, although still not polished as ubuntu.</p>
<p><br />
So if free software is important to you and if you like starry nights then squeeze is for you.</p>
