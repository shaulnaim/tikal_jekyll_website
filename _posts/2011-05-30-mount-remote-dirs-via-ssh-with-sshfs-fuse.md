<p>Well, there is nothing like a simple and easy innovative solutions to save the day -it's been around for quite a while and never really needed it until now ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Use Case</strong></u><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>we moved Subversion from server A to server B and we wanted to bea ble to utilze the same backup scripts we were using so one (not real elegant way) was to mount the remote location via NFS which has its issues, from time to time you will meet stale NFS records and such so that is almost in all cases out of the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A neat solution would be to mount over SSH a specific directory run svnhotbackup and close the share, I took this to another level by utilising this over a VDSL connection which worked like a charm, so how do we do this ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are on Ubuntu (<a href="#aptget">see install snippet below</a>):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre title="code" class="brush: css;">
sudo apt-get install sshfs
</pre>
<p>add fuse to your /etc/modules [edit /etc/modules and add the word fuse on a single line]</p>
<pre title="code" class="brush: css;">
vi /etc/modules ...
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On CentOs / Redhat / Fedora [ you need to enable <em><strong>rpmforge</strong></em> / <em><strong>epel</strong></em> repository ] - (<a href="#yum">see install snippet below</a>):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the host you want to mount generate an ssh key by executing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre title="code" class="brush: css;">
ssh-genkey -t rsa 
</pre>
<p>[press return twice with no passphrase]</p>
<pre title="code" class="brush: css;">
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@remotehost
</pre>
<p>- this will automatically add the public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote server for the specified user.  make a directory representing your remote server</p>
<pre title="code" class="brush: css;">
mkdir /mnt/remoteservername
</pre>
<p>Then in any place you can execute [prompt / shell script]:</p>
<pre title="code" class="brush: css;">
sshfs username@ipaddress:/remote/directory /mnt/remoteservername
</pre>
<p>then you can of course run:</p>
<pre title="code" class="brush: css;">
ls -l /mnt/remoteservername 
</pre>
<p>as if you were running on the local machine.  Back to our story above we could noe reference our svn setup as if it was local by running:</p>
<pre title="code" class="brush: css;">
svnadmin hotbackup /mnt/remoteservername/svn /my-local-bakcup-directory.
</pre>
<p>This quite neat don't you think ?</p>
