<p>&quot;One of the common myths about open source software is that it is  developed by communities of individuals. It is a myth that continues to  propagate despite <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/docs/lf_linux_kernel_development_2010.pdf">multiple</a> <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/07-028.pdf">sources</a> of <a href="http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=tony_wasserman&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22Framework%20Evaluating%20Managerial%20Styles%20Open%20SourceProjects.%22">data</a> that show the depth and breadth of corporate contributions to open source software.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;individuals are prominent in many Eclipse projects as well &ndash; dominating  the Eclipse Communications Framework and GMT projects for example.&quot;</p>
