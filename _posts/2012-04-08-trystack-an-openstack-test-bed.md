<p>TryStack [<a href="http://www.openstack.org/blog/2012/02/trystack-org-a-sandbox-for-openstack/">announced Feb 16th</a>], is a test bed of OpenStack's &quot;latest and gratest&quot; - well not quite the latest and graetest but it will get there...,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can watch the presntation by <a rel="nofollow" class="dsq-commenter-name" target="_blank" href="http://joinfu.com/">Jay Pipes</a> on TryStack's architecture and services&nbsp; <a href="http://bit.ly/trystack-sandbox-for-openstack">here</a> .</p>
<p>This is a great opertunity of understanding what OpenStack can give you without starting setting it up yourself, atough there are a few howto's around on how to go about and do so to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to try TryStack go to https://trystack.org/ and join the TryStack group on Facebook and get your account, there are currently 1,204 members which is pretty impressive. TryStack's available resources are: 156 cores, 1040GB memory and 59.1 which is also quite impressive for a free, community intiative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> any instance you may setup will only be available for 24 hours - so don't try going production on this ...</p>
