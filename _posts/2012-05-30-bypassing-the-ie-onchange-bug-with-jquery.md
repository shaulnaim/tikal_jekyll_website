<p>I absolutely love <a href='http://www.jquery.com'>jQuery</a>! I use it daily with my client side work, putting the jQuery file into my JS library has become an automated thing I do.</p>

<p>Well, after saying that, even jQuery can’t fix all the IE bugs and quirks. Sometimes you have to bypass them with intelligence and some style<!--more--></p>

<p>The bug I’m talking about is the one that disables the “onchange” event from firing when the element still has focus.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is absolutely frustrating when you have to react to a checkbox or a radiobutton.</p>

<p>Well, like everything else in jQuery, after scratching my head for a second or two (or 20, or 200) I came up with this solution:</p>
<script src='http://gist.github.com/214459.js' />
<p>This works like a charm.</p>

<p>Good luck! If you find it useful drop me a line in the comments below…</p>
