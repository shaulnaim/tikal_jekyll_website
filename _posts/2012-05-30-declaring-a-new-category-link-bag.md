<p>Well, I have decided. After a while of reading very interesting blogs and stumbling upon quite a few useful links for fellow developers, I decided to put together a new category in the blog.</p>

<p>The category will be called ”<a href='http://www.kensodev.com/category/link-bag/' title='Link Bag'>link bag</a>” and I will post new things to it on a weekly basis hopefully.</p>

<p>The links will vary from technology links to freelancing tips, everything that is an interest to me and hopefully for the readers of this blog as well.</p>

<p>You can keep yourself up to date though the <a href='http://feeds.feedburner.com/KensoDev-en'>RSS Feed</a> or come back later this week.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
