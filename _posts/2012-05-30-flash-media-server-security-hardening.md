<p>Today, while browsing my feed in google reader, I found something very interesting. This <a href='http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashmediaserver/articles/hardening_guide.html'>link</a> is a hardening guide for <a href='http://www.kensodev.com/tag/flash-media-server/' title='Flash media server'>flash media server</a>.</p>

<p>For quite some time now I have been developing and consulting on flash media server advanced topics. I have been teaching students and consulting companies on issues regarding this great peace of software.</p>
<a href='http://www.kensodev.com/tag/adobe/' title='Adobe'>Adobe</a>
<p>I highly recommend you to open the link and read it.</p>
