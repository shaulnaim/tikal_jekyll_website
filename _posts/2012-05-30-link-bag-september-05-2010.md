<p>Yet another post that will gather links and useful information of intersting stuff, that will probably be useful to my readers. <h2>General</h2> <a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CodeBetter/~3/Q4nfqG-olcc/launching-beta-or-how-to-decide-when-and-where-to-cut-corners.aspx' target='_blank'> Launching beta, or “How to decide when and where to cut corners</a> - A great post from <a href='http://CodeBetter.com'>CodeBetter.com</a> with a reference to <a href='http://kohari.org/'>Nate Kohari's</a> post on the same subject. A very good read if you are planning in launching a product anytime soon. <h2>Freelancing</h2> <a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreelanceSwitch/~3/WxF8mgNbf3E/'>10 Requirements for Working with Clients in Other Countries</a> - I work with clients in other countries all of the time, mostly in the US and Japan. Therefore, I think this post will be very useful if you are in the same situation. I got something out of it, and so will you.</p>
<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/SixRevisions/~3/fbakDDeyN5k/'>Craftsmanship in Designing Websites</a><h2>CSS</h2><a href='http://devign.me/css-stretch-a-box-to-its-parent-bounds/'>CSS: Stretch a Box to its Parent’s Bounds</a><h2>GIT</h2>
<p>I am (as you already know) a huge fan of Git. I know Git is a big source of misuse and misunderstanding. I have read a couple of great posts about it recently on how to use GitK tool.</p>
<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LosTechies/~3/ZShb4VMewhc/use-gitk-to-understand-git.aspx'>use-gitk-to-understand-git.aspx</a><a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LosTechies/~3/-zSO-aPGUk4/use-gitk-to-understand-git-merge-and-rebase.aspx'>Use gitk to understand git – merge and rebase</a>
<p>That’s all for now. Hope you’ll find my post useful.</p>
