<p>Hi All,</p>

<p>I have been using the <a href='http://www.robotlegs.org/' target='_blank'>RobotLegs</a> MVC framework for <a href='http://www.kensodev.com/category/flex/' target='_blank' title='Flex'>flex</a> for about a month and a half now, I have been using <a href='http://mate.asfusion.com/' target='_blank'>MATE</a> before that and <a href='http://puremvc.org/' target='_blank'>PureMVC</a> before that, I have never got so much out of an MVC framework, it is so flexible, so customizable (<a href='http://github.com/KensoDev/robotlegs-framework' target='_blank'>the code is on git</a>) and helps me with my tasks all of the time.</p>

<p>So, why have I posted it on the blog and not just tweeted about it? Well, I have tweeted about it for quite a bit, but the real reason for posting it on the blog is that I have made a new category on the blog called <a href='http://www.kensodev.com/category/robotlegs/'>RobotLegs</a>.</p>

<p>I plan on posting some example code for it and being involved in the community.</p>

<p>You can keep yourself updated through my <a href='http://feeds.feedburner.com/KensoDev-en' target='_blank'>RSS FEED</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
