<p>Hey all,</p>

<p>This post is the beginning of a series of posts.</p>

<p>What are the posts about?</p>

<p>Well, I just started a consulting session at a major financial start-up company. This consulting session as many of my sessions are long, they include a variety of technologies, server, client and scalability issues.</p>

<p>As a consultant in all projects but specific in this one, I do a lot of research. I write documents and applications that prove my points and just air tight my meetings with the company team with decisions regarding their needs.</p>

<p>I never work with something I have used already from another session because then you are tempted to fit a solution that is not necessarily tailor made on your client. I hate doing that. The customer is paying for more then that and I should supply the materials that are right for him.</p>

<p>So, you are probably wondering how can I write about it.. Well, it’s because I signed an NDA right and since I will not mention the company name at any point, I will not be uncovering any details that might compromise data from the company nor the code.</p>

<p>So what will I be doing?</p>

<p>I will share all of the applications that I build to prove my point, such as socket connection between flex 3 and a windows service, AMF using webOrb.net and more.</p>

<p>Also, I will be testing solutions such as BlazeDS or LCDS which are the interest to many of you who are building serious enterprise application.</p>

<p>The user base This is a real treat. The application is meant to support up to 20,000 concurrent connections and concurrent users, so scale is a really big issue here, this will be a big part in my research and the solution I will deliver.</p>

<p>The technology .Net (2, 3.5) SQL server (2005, 2008) Flex 3 (AS3) Html, Javascript 3rd party applications and solutions like webOrb.net or other solutions</p>

<p>A maybe FMS (Flash Media Server)</p>

<p>The post will be long with many examples, links and many more.</p>

<p>Feel free to comment with questions or email me at avi AT kensodev DOT com and I will try to include all of the questions in the posts</p>
