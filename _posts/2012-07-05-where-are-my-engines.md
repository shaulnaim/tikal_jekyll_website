<p>Right now, I am working on an engine for the Gogobot application.</p>
<p>As part of my work on the engine, I am working with the Mongoid gem and the Fabrication gem, both great gems b.t.w.</p>
<p>The problem with Fabrication is that it wasn’t really adapted to working with Engines and it was relying a lot on Rails.root for where to locate the fabricator files.</p>
<p>Since in an engine, the application is located in spec/dummy I needed a better way locate the fabricators.</p>
<p>ok… so far the story of how I got to even writing this post.</p>
<p>To solve my problem I needed to grab all of the engines that are included inside the Rails application.</p>
<p>Turns out, there’s a real easy way to do it.</p>
