<p>I wrote a blog post in my other personal blog about how to create a machine that will manage it’s own lifecycle.</p>
<p>I work a lot with background workers, and I constantly need a better way to manage my Resque worker machines, so I wrote a post about how I did it.</p>
<p>I booted up over 50 servers with about 600 Resque workers using this method, and all with a click of a button in the UI.</p>
<p>Worth your time to read it if you are using Resque/Sidekiq and you need to add workers on rush-times of your site or something.</p>
