<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have had a serious issue I stumbled upon whilst using Jenkins 1.491 [<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-15865">JENKINS-15865</a>&nbsp;to be specific].</p>
<p>If for any chance Maven builds which worked well until 1.491 no longer do, or more specific test do not start executing continue reading ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running maven failsafe caused Jenkins NPE and builds were crashing with:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre title="code" class="brush: java;">
...

...</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An upgrade to 1.492 solves this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were quite a few more issues but this one gave me some serious doubts on using the Latest vs. LTS for quite a few builds had become useless with no code changes internally who could of caused this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you find this useful.</p>
<p>HP</p>
