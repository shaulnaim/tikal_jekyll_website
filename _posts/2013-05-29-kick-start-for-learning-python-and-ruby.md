<p>For a long time - since I&#39;m using many ALM tools - I have &#39;<strong>Learn Python</strong>&#39; and &#39;<strong>Learn Ruby</strong>&#39; in my TODO list, but I never found the right time or kick-in-the-bottom to actually do it.</p>
<p>Yesterday I found a short time-window - and since I&#39;ve been feeling lucky (...) I&#39;ve asked the &#39;big-brother&#39; Google for a quick way to jump into both Ruby and Python so I found those 2 entry-points:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Learn Python</strong> -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.learnpython.org/">http://www.learnpython.org/</a></li>
	<li>
		<strong>Try Ruby</strong> -&nbsp;<a href="http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0">http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And&nbsp;<strong>YES</strong>&nbsp;I&#39;m feeling lucky this time!!!</p>
<p>After those 2 short interactive (and fun) sessions I&#39;m not a big expert in Ruby and Python (yet...), but now I have - at least - a clue about both programming languages and I truely recommend those sites (even that there are probably many other good ones).</p>
<p>Enjoy,</p>
