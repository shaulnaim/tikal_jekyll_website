One of the very nice feature of linux is the option for auto complete on the command line. Yes windows has the power shell, but it is not the same as linux.<br />
For those in windows and want a linux shell you can install&nbsp;Cygwin (<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>).<br />
<br />
For those of us that use maven, think of how nice it would be to have auto complete for maven commands.<br />
Well this is possible, have a look at:<br />

<br />
If you are using Cygwin then just copy the script to \cygwin64\etc\bash.bashrc
