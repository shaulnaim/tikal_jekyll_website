<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Choosing the right Git hosting service is not an easy task and&nbsp;there is </span>no<b> one solution that fits all organizations</b> - each organization have different factors to consider while making that decision.</p>

<p>Lately, once coming to migrate some projects to GIT (from CVS or SVN - see the tool I&#39;ve created in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tikalk/tikal-alm-tools">https://github.com/tikalk/tikal-alm-tools</a>), I repeatly being asked: <strong>which Git hosting service to use for the teams collaboration</strong>?</p>

<p>Basically, each organization have different aspects to consider so there is no one solution that fits all.</p>

<p>In order to help reaching a good decision about the issue, I&#39;ve published some slides that includes the main questions each organization should ask and I&#39;ve included some of the leading solutions out there - even that there are many other solutions.</p>

<p>In general, the main decision to make is usually whether to host the Git repositories locally or to use a cloud-based service.</p>

<p>Once this decision is clear, there are some local options or cloud-based options to consider.</p>

<p>So here are the slides:</p>
